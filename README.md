## 🔗 Why PHP?
PHP may be known as a web development language, but it’s surprisingly effective for **solving algorithmic problems** too. Here’s why I chose PHP:
- **Familiarity**: PHP has been my go-to language, and it’s always fun to push it beyond web dev.
- **Challenge**: Algorithm challenges in PHP come with a unique twist, as the language is sometimes less optimized for these tasks, making the challenges more rewarding.
- **Skill Development**: Using PHP for coding challenges helps sharpen both my problem-solving and language-specific skills.
